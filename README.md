# Portfolio Generator

## Overview
A node app to creat a basic portfolio webpage with general information about yourself and your github projects. 

## Installation and Usage
To use for yourself, clone the repo to your machine, then delete files from 'dist' folder so that it is empty. Remember to install the necessary node modules from the command line(npm install). From the root directory, run 'node index.js' to begin using the application. Once you have finished in the command line, your index.html and style.css file will be outputted in the /dist folder.
